This document outlines the optimizations implemented in the Deribit trading application to enhance performance, reduce latency, and handle higher throughput. The primary focus is on improving network communication, asynchronous operations, efficient data handling, and robust error handling.

Key Optimizations
1. Asynchronous Operations
Description: Asynchronous operations are used to perform network requests without blocking the main thread. This allows the application to continue running while waiting for responses from the server.

Implementation:
std::async is used to execute network requests asynchronously.
The main thread can continue interacting with the user while network operations are handled in the background.

2. Efficient Data Structures
Description: Efficient data structures like std::unordered_map are used for fast access and caching, reducing the time spent on data lookups.

Implementation:

std::unordered_map is used to cache order responses for faster access.


3. Latency Measurement and Optimization
Description: Latency measurement is implemented to identify and optimize performance bottlenecks. The LatencyModule is used to measure the time taken for different operations.
Implementation:

LatencyModule::start() and LatencyModule::end() are used to measure latency for various operations.


4. Real-time Data Processing
Description: The system processes incoming market data in real-time to ensure timely updates and actions.
Implementation:

Market data is processed as soon as it is received, and subscribers are notified.


5. Robust Error Handling and Reconnection Logic
Description: Robust error handling and reconnection logic are implemented to ensure the system can recover from network disconnections and other errors.
Implementation:

Exceptions are caught and handled gracefully.
Reconnection logic is implemented to automatically reconnect to the WebSocket server if the connection is lost.


6. Thread Pool for Concurrent Processing
Description: A thread pool is used to manage a fixed number of threads, reducing the overhead of thread creation and destruction.
Implementation:

A thread pool is implemented to handle concurrent tasks efficiently.


7. Non-blocking User Input
Description: Non-blocking user input methods are used to avoid blocking the main thread and improve responsiveness.
Implementation:

User input is handled in a separate thread to avoid blocking the main thread.


Conclusion
By implementing these optimizations, the Deribit trading application is better equipped to handle higher throughput, reduce latency, and improve overall performance. These changes ensure that the system remains responsive and efficient, even under high load conditions.
